Click on the "Project Settings" button located on the top-right corner of your screen.

From the dropdown menu, click on "Routes".

In the "Routes" page, you can create new routes and redirects by clicking on the "Add" button.

To create a new redirect, select "Redirect" from the dropdown menu, enter the source URL and destination URL, and configure any additional settings as needed.
